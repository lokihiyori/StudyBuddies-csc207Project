# StudyBuddies-csc207Project
This software would allow students to create an account with a profile that displays all their
enrolled courses and their emails. Once users have logged in, they will join a group for each of
their courses. Users can search for other students in their courses, using other users' profiles to
see which courses they are enrolled in and their emails. Each course will have a group chat that
will include all the students enrolled in that course.
